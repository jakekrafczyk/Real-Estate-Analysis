# Real-Estate-Analysis

#### This repository is the dumping ground for the code I use to source lists of property owners likely to sell houses in Pittsburgh in the near future. The notebooks are mostly cleaning and filtering data from Allegheny County's property tax delinquent list. The search_allrep.py file takes the tax delinquent properties that fit our parameters and scrapes the Allegheny real estate portal for additional data which again is filtered down to just the rows that fit our parameters. If you're a realtor or real estate investor looking for a custom property search like this you can send me an email at jakekrafczyk@gmail.com.
