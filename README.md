# Real-Estate-Analysis

#### This repository is the dumping ground for the code I use to source lists of property owners likely to sell houses in Pittsburgh in the near future. The notebooks are mostly cleaning and filtering the data and the search_allrep.py file scrapes the allegheny portal for additional data which again is filtered down to just the rows we want. If you're a realtor or real estate investor looking for a custom property search like this you can send me an email at jakekrafczyk@gmail.com.
